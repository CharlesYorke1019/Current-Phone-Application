# Current-Phone-Application
Code for phone application as of September 6th, 2023.

Application is written in JS (React-Native) and uses Socket.io for a server

Just started teaching myself React/React-Native about 3 weeks ago (this was written on Wed, September 20th, 2023) so there are definitly some things to approve upon

But I have accounted for all game logic game sizes 2-9, guest/logged in users, and group logic, friends logic, alerts logic and sign out logic for logged in users

I also have a youtube video displaying what the application looks like

YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBU7zdrDCtuC8X6yzTg1J6A

Also for the youtube video I could not show what its like when other users interact with eachother outside of the game or in game, because at the time of recording the video,
only had one device (my phone) to portray what the application looks like and how it functions but I have tested it with multiple devices previously so everything is functional in how I want it to be. 

And yes I could've use the IOS simulator on my computer, but my computer is 
so old and on the verge of just shutting down so I don't even risk it (because when I used IOS simulator on my computer for the first time it almost broke my computer)

But logged in users can...
- add friends
- create groups and invite other users to that group (games can also be created through the group)
- invite other users to games
- accept/decline all possible invites
- delete their account
- delete their groups
- remove friends



Other than that really just need to clean up some things (especially the server) and work on handling more errors than the application already handles
